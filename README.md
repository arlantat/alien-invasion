A codealong of alien invasion game, from Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes. The first ever project I had done, before I studied any official programming course.

### Status update in Jan 2024
Since then I've coded countless OOP projects, but truthfully none of them tops this one in object-oriented design (separating objects and logics into modules) and clean code (minimising duplicates and simplicity). It's actually cool how sometimes you can also learn by taking a hop back to the old times.

### Features:
- Moving fleet of aliens
- Player controls a ship by moving and firing bullets
- Game speed increases as player completes stages
- Hi-score is saved
