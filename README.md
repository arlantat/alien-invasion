### Status update in Jan 2024
Since then I've coded countless OOP projects, but truthfully none of them tops this one in object-oriented design (separating objects and logics into modules) and clean code (minimising duplicates and simplicity). It's actually cool how sometimes you can also learn by taking a hop back to the old times.
